       # Returns detailed status with recovery guidance
   ```
   **Impact**: Prevents accidental execution without proper network privileges.

2. **Multi-Tier Rate Limiting**:
   ```python
   # Refactored only - policy-based rate enforcement
   def _validate_rate_policy(self, rate: int, target: str) -> Optional[ToolOutput]:
       if rate > self.MAX_RATE_SAFE and not self.allow_intrusive:
           # Block high-rate scans without intrusive flag
   ```
   **Impact**: Implements graduated safety controls based on scan intensity.

3. **Template-Based Scanning**:
   ```python
   # Refactored only - safe, predefined scan templates
   async def run_with_template(self, target: str, template: MasscanTemplate, ...) -> ToolOutput:
       args = self._get_template_args(template)
   ```
   **Impact**: Provides safe, guided usage patterns for common scenarios.

4. **Multi-Format Output Parsing**:
   ```python
   # Refactored only - intelligent result processing
   def _parse_masscan_output(self, output: str) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
