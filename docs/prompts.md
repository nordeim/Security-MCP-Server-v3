awesome job in doing the meticulous review and analysis of the given code files! please use the same rigorous and meticulous approach to review and validate the project's remaining MCP sever code files below.

---
awesome job! now, please meticulously review again all the original core files for the custom MCP server build together with your suggested enhancements and fixes, validate your original plus enhancements and fixes line by line, double-check again for any syntax, coding and logic errors. then meticulously create a comprehensive execution plan to create a complete production-ready *drop-in* replacement file for each of the files that need updating, include in your plan integrated checklist for each file that needs updating. then review and validate your plan before executing cautiously to create complete fully working updated version for the following core files. after generating each updated file, validate that the updated file is complete without any placeholder comments and that the checklist passed.

- server.py
- config.py
- health.py
- metrics.py
- circuit_breaker.py
- base_tool.py

awesome job! now, please think deeper and think harder to meticulously create a comprehensive plan to create a complete updated `.env.example` and `Project Architecture Document`, include an integrated checklist for each file, then review and validate the plan before proceeding carefully. make sure your `Project Architecture Document` document the updated codebase for the project accurately, add a codebase file hierarchy diagram, a detailed mermaid diagram to show the program flow for user, file and modules interactions, list each file with a description and their interfaces, and include a guide to add a new tool. your `PAD document in markdown format should serve as a handbook for new developers/contributors to maintain the codebase and to extend the codebase with more tools in future. please meticulously review the PAD after creation to double-check for accuracy and completeness. thank you, my very best AI coding expert and helpful partner!
