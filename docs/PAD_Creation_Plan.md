# Plan: Project Architecture Document (PAD) Creation

## 1. Objective

The primary goal is to create a comprehensive **Project Architecture Document (PAD)** that serves as the single source of truth for developers. This document will provide a deep dive into the system's architecture, components, and logic flows, enabling a new developer to get up to speed with the project quickly and efficiently.

## 2. Audience

The target audience is a new developer joining the project. The document should assume they have general software engineering knowledge but are unfamiliar with this specific codebase.

## 3. PAD Outline & Content Strategy

The `Project_Architecture_Document.md` will be structured into the following sections.

### Section 1: Introduction
-   **Content:** A high-level summary of the project's purpose: to provide secure, monitored access to network security tools for AI agents via the Model Context Protocol (MCP).
-   **Strategy:** I will synthesize this from the "Overview" section of the `README.md` and my own understanding.

### Section 2: System Architecture
-   **Content:** A Mermaid diagram illustrating the high-level components and their interactions (e.g., MCP Server, Tool Registry, Health Manager, Metrics Manager, Circuit Breaker, Tools).
-   **Strategy:** I will adapt the architecture diagram from the `README.md` to ensure it accurately reflects the codebase I have reviewed, adding detail where necessary.

### Section 3: File Hierarchy & Key Components
-   **Content:**
    1.  A tree-like representation of the project's file structure, generated from the provided file list.
    2.  A detailed breakdown of the most critical files/modules, explaining their responsibilities.
-   **Strategy:**
    -   I will format the provided file list into a clear, hierarchical structure.
    -   For the key components, I will write a detailed description for each of the following, explaining its role and significance:
        -   `mcp_server/server.py`: The application's core request handler and orchestrator.
        -   `mcp_server/base_tool.py`: The security foundation for all tools.
        -   `mcp_server/tools/`: The extensible tool module system.
        -   `mcp_server/config.py`: The configuration management system.
        -   `mcp_server/health.py`: The health monitoring engine.
        -   `mcp_server/metrics.py`: The observability and metrics collection system.
        -   `mcp_server/circuit_breaker.py`: The resilience pattern implementation.
        -   `Dockerfile` & `docker-compose.yml`: The deployment and containerization strategy.

### Section 4: Execution Flow Diagrams
-   **Content:** Two Mermaid diagrams to visualize the application's logic.
    1.  **User Interaction Flow (Sequence Diagram):** Shows the sequence of events from an AI agent's request to the final response, illustrating the interaction between the MCP Server, Tool Registry, Circuit Breaker, and a specific Tool.
    2.  **Application Logic Flow (Flowchart):** A more detailed flowchart that visualizes the internal logic of the `MCPBaseTool.run()` method, including input validation, security checks, concurrency control (semaphore), circuit breaker checks, command execution, and metrics recording.
-   **Strategy:** I will meticulously design these diagrams to be accurate representations of the code's execution path.

### Section 5: Core Concepts Deep Dive
-   **Content:** Dedicated sections explaining the key architectural concepts.
    1.  **Security Model:** Detail the "defense in depth" strategy, covering network restrictions, input validation (whitelisting), script filtering, and policy-gated intrusive operations.
    2.  **Observability:** Explain how health checks and Prometheus metrics work together to provide a complete picture of the system's status.
    3.  **Configuration:** Describe the multi-source configuration system and the priority order (Env > File > Defaults).
    4.  **Extensibility:** Provide a concise, step-by-step guide on how a developer would create and add a new, safe tool to the system.
-   **Strategy:** I will write clear, concise explanations for each concept, using examples from the code to illustrate the points.
